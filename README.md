<h3>Rent A Movie</h3>
<p>
This is a template designed for my ASP.Net Rent A Movie project. Designed in Bootstrap 4. Still under construction. The project involves input of a customer's details, movie details and user details. The homepage contains data from IMDB which will be acquired from the IMDB api. Since the  front-end is still on its first phase of production, the project folder only contains a small number of files. The project will further be compartmentalised into the admin and user sections. The admin will contain the dashboard, customer display and movie display. Users will be able to access details of a particular movie, watch trailers, view summary and ratings based on different rating sources. This is a project under The Amber Projects umbrella.
